# Pokedex – MTM6302 Final Project

## Description

This is a simple Pokedex web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It uses the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to:

- Load Pokémon in batches of 20.
- Display them in a responsive grid with thumbnail and name.
- Show a larger image and more details (types, abilities, height, weight) when a Pokémon is selected.
- Let the user mark Pokémon as **caught** and save them in localStorage.
- Let the user **release** Pokémon from the caught list.

The app is fully client-side and uses the Fetch API for all asynchronous requests.
